# Change Log

## v3.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- v3.0.0 requires cspace-ui version 6. On the record editor form for Object records, the annotation field group (`annotationGroupList`) has been added. These fields are defined in cspace-ui version 6.0.0, but not in prior versions. To use this version of cspace-ui-plugin-profile-materials with an older version of cspace-ui, this field group should be hidden; otherwise, any values entered will not be saved.

## v2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- v2.0.0 requires cspace-ui version 4.
